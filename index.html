                Beşiktaş Jimnastik Kulübü (lit. 'Beşiktaş Gymnastics Club'), also known simply as Beşiktaş (Turkish pronunciation: [beˈʃiktaʃ]), is a Turkish sports club founded in 1903 that is based in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul. The club's football team is one of the Big Three in Turkey and one of the most successful teams in the country, having never been relegated to a lower division. It was the first registered sports club in the country and one of the few that acquired the right to bear the Turkish flag on its crest.

                    <h3>FOUNDING YEARS</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the fall of 1902, a group of 22 youngsters gathered in the garden of Madina Guard Osman Pasha’s mansion located in Serencebey, Beşiktaş on certain days of the week and practiced gymnastics. Led by Osman Pasha’s sons Mehmet Şamil and Hüseyin Bereket, the group, which included well-known neighborhood boys such as Ahmet Fetgari, Mehmet Ali Fetgeri, Nazımnazif Cemil Feti and Şevket Bey, was also interested in wrestling and weightlifting. But at that time, all public gatherings were strictly banned by the Sultan Abdul Hamid II for political reasons. When the Sultan heard of what was taking place in Serencebey, he ordered his special forces to raid the mansion, and the practicing youngsters were soon taken to the nearest police station. Luckily, since most boys were close to the Palace and did not actually engaged in playing football, a forbidden sport at that time, they were let go without being charged and allowed to carry on.  Furthermore, in the following days, the sultan’s own son Abdülhalim publicly announced his backing of the boys and attended the practice sessions in person frequently. The famous Turkish boxer and wrestler Kenan Bey also started training the boys on a regular basis.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Bereket Gymnastics Club was founded in March 1903 under a special permission from the authorities. After the declaration of constitutional monarchy in 1908, the restrictions on sports were eased considerably.  Following the political events of April 13, 1909, Fuat Balkan and Mazhar Kazancı came to Istanbul from Edirne City with the Ottoman Movement Army. After the restoration of political order, Fuat Balkan, a proven fencing coach, and Mazhar Kazancı, a good wrestler and weightlifter, found the boys in Serencebey and succeeded in persuading them to train together.  Fuat Balkan allowed the first floor of his house in Ihlamur, Beşiktaş to be used as club headquarters, and the title of Bereket Gymnastics Club was changed to Beşiktaş Ottoman Gymnastics Club.  Thus, a sports club with gymnastics, track & field, wrestling, boxing, and fencing sections was founded. Refik and Şerafettin Begs, friends of Fuat Bey, were prominent fencers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With the support of Beyoğlu Governor Muhittin Bey, Beşiktaş Ottoman Gymnastics Club became the first registered Turkish sports club on January 26, 1911.  The interest among local youths in the club grew rapidly, and the number of members actively engaged in club activities went up to 150. The club headquarters eventually was moved from Ihlamur to the larger building, no. 49, in Akaretler. When this building was too small to serve the needs of the club after a while; the building, no. 84, again in Akaretler, became new headquarters. The yard behind this building was turned into a sports pitch.

                    <h3>BEŞİKTAŞ JK'S FIRST CREST AND COLOURS</h3>
                    <p>
                        For years, the original colours of the Beşiktaş were believed to be Red and White; and then temporarily changed into Black and White as a sign of mourning for the dead in Balkan Wars, which included some players of the club. Although most written sources endorse this claim, a detailed study carried out for Beşiktaş’s 100th anniversary documentary had shown that red was never used in club’s first colors; and Beşiktaş’s colours were always Black and White. The 100th Anniversary documentary produced by Mr. Tuğrul Yenidoğan, has put an end to further arguments on the subject once and for all.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since, at the beginning, only individual sports were being practiced in the Osman Pasha Mansion, there was no need for team colours or uniform. However, as the number of active sportsmen increased each passing day; Mehmet Şamil Bey, who had graduated from a well-known French school, asked the Founders Committee to hold a meeting on finding a badge for the club. He removed the pin badge he used in his school days bearing the colours of his school from his lapel and showed it around. He said, “We must have a crest just like this one, and all club members must wear it.” Those attending the meeting eagerly agreed to Mehmet Şamil Bey’s proposal. At the end of the meeting, the colours of the Club to be shown on the crest were decided. The two principal colors of nature in full contrast to each other were chosen as the Club colours: Black and White…
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The date Beşiktaş’s crest inspired by the pins of a French school has carried the date of “1906,” the year of its first issue, in Latin. At the top, the word “Beşiktaş” was written in Arabic, with the letter “J” on the right and the letter “K” on the left. The inscription at the back of the shows that it was made in “Konstantinopolis,” and the seal of the craftsman who made the crest is placed in the middle. It is interesting that the star on the crest on the pin has six points. This six-pointed star had been used until the Second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908. The original crest was presented to our Honorary Chairman Süleyman Seba by Iskender Yakak

                    <h3>THE LEGEND of BLACK EAGLES</h3>
                    <p>
                        The title holder of the past two seasons, Beşiktaş started the 1940-41 season with a young and renewed team. As weeks went by, the Black and White had built up a sizeable lead over the other teams and were sitting alone atop the league table. Five weeks remaining to the end of season, the opponent was Süleymaniye. Beşiktaş had started the match, which was played at Şeref Stadium on Sunday January 19, 1941and refereed by Semih Turansoy with a lineup consisting of   Faruk, Yavuz, İbrahim, Rıfat, Halil, Hüseyin, Şakir, Hakkı, Şükrü, Şeref, and Eşref. As in all games of that season, our team played magnificently. Half way through the second half, despite being comfortably ahead, Beşiktaş attacked endlessly from both flanks to the delight of their fans. Then, a voice was heard from the section of Şeref Stadium towards which Beşiktaş was attacking, “Come on Black Eagles… Attack Black Eagles...” Thousands of fans and journalists following the game that filled the Şeref Stadium were frozen by the echoing sound. Everyon had agreed that the observation was right on target.  It was not possible to describe the Beşiktaş players who crushed over their opponents that season as nothing other than “Black Eagles,” and the type of football they played as nothing other than “Attacking Black Eagles.” The owner of the voice coming from the stands was a fisherman called Mehmet Galin.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Beşiktaş won the game 6-0 lead with 3 volley goals from Şeref Görkey, who was known as “Şeref the Volleyer” and one goal each from Captain Hakkı, Şakir and Şükrü.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After this game, Beşiktaş’s symbol has become “Black Eagles.”

                    <h3>BEŞİKTAŞ and FOOTBALL</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although football was overshadowed by other sports in the early period, starting from late 1910s, the athletes and the gymnasts of the Club began to show more interest in football and played matches among themselves. In those years, the interest of the youth was about to shift to football, and two local clubs, known as Valideçeşme and Basiret, were formed not too far away from the Beşiktaş Club. In August 1911, Ahmet Şerafettin Bey (Şeref Bey), the Chairman and Founder of Valideçeşme Football Club, joined Beşiktaş with his players. As a result of the attempts by Şeref Bey, who was trying to bring all local football clubs under one roof, Basiret Club joined Beşiktaş as well. Thus, a football section had started operating officially within the Club.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        All material needs of Beşiktaş’s first football team, which was made up of Resul, Rıdvan, Behzat, Doctor Sabri, Poet Kazım, Sadi (Baltalimanı), Doctor Mehmet, Asım, Şeref, Doctor Ali and Fahri, were met by an ardent club supporter named İpekçi İhsan. In addition to seniors, the section went on to form three more teams and started holding regular trainings in the garden of the Club building in Akaretler.  Consequently, football had become the main activity of the Club. However, the devastating Balkan Wars of 1912 - 1913 and the ensuing World War I had a profound impact on Turkish sports and would slow down the club’s development significantly.

                    <h3>POST-WAR YEARS</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the ending of the World War I, surviving sportsmen began to come back to Beşiktaş one by one. Şerey Bey, the founder of football section, also returned from the Romanian front. It was not easy to keep the club running during the occupation of Istanbul. The materials and documents of the club hidden in a nearby church were later taken to a building in Akaretler to prevent them from being plundered by the invading Greeks. While Beşiktaş were secretly engaged in the National Resistance efforts against the Allied Forces, Şeref Bey managed to rebuild the club’s football team.

                    <h3>TURKISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE</h3>
                    <p>
                        At that time, the Istanbul Friday League included teams such as Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray, Altınordu, Süleymaniye and İdman Yurdu. Although the Black and White had never played the future cross-town rivals Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray before 1920s, they had beaten Süleymaniye and İdman Yurdu several times. The 1919 applications of Beşiktaş and other local teams to join the Friday League were subsequently rejected by the Admissions Committee, after a long wait. Meanwhile, a separate league called Istanbul Sunday League was taking place among the minority teams of Pera, Araks, Maccabi, Stella, and Strugglers. But all these would not deter Şeref Bey from forming the ten-team Turkish Training Union League with the directors of other rejected teams. Following a draw, while Beşiktaş, Hilal, Kumkapı, Altınörs and Türkgücü were placed in Group A, Darüşşafaka, Vefa, Üsküdar, Beylerbeyi and Haliç would compete in Group-B.

                    <h3>İNÖNÜ STADIUM</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>İnönü Stadium was opened in 1947</strong>
                        The stadium, whose plans were drawn by architects Vietti Violi , Şinasi Şahingiray ve and Fazıl Aysu, was inaugurated on 19 May 1947 by İsmet İnönü, the second President of Turkey and Lütfi Kırdar, the Governor of Istanbul. The first football match at the stadium took place between Beşiktaş JK and AIK Stockholm of Sweden on 27 November 1947, and during that game, Süleyman Seba, the longest-presiding Chairman of Beşiktaş JK, scored the first goal in stadium history.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong>In 1998, it was rented out to Beşiktaş JK for 49 years</strong>
                        On 8 February 1998, a leasing contract was signed between Beşiktaş JK and the Ministry of Youth and Sports which gave all usage rights of the Inönü Stadium to Beşiktaş JK for 49 years. From that date onwards, the stadium was named BJK (Beşiktaş JK initials) İnönü Stadium.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong>Renovation work (2004)</strong>
                        Renovation work took place at the BJK İnönü Stadium in 2004. The tartan track was removed within the scope of these activities, and the ground level was lowered by 4 meters to increase the capacity of the stadium from 16,000 to 32,145 spectators. The press seats were relocated, and for the first time in Turkey, the wire fence between the stands and the pitch were removed for space. The number of the gates were increased by 100% and a press centre for Beşiktaş JK TV was built inside the stadium. The toilets and the launch counters were renewed to make them comply with the UEFA standards.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong>Farewell to BJK İnönü Stadium (2013)</strong>
                        After tearing down the BJK İnönü Stadium in June 2013, the construction work for the new Beşiktaş JK stadium got underway in November 2013.
