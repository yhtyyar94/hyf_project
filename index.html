                Beşiktaş Jimnastik Kulübü (lit. 'Beşiktaş Gymnastics Club'), also known simply as Beşiktaş (Turkish pronunciation: [beˈʃiktaʃ]), is a Turkish sports club founded in 1903 that is based in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul. The club's football team is one of the Big Three in Turkey and one of the most successful teams in the country, having never been relegated to a lower division. It was the first registered sports club in the country and one of the few that acquired the right to bear the Turkish flag on its crest.

                    <h3>FOUNDING YEARS</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the fall of 1902, a group of 22 youngsters gathered in the garden of Madina Guard Osman Pasha’s mansion located in Serencebey, Beşiktaş on certain days of the week and practiced gymnastics. Led by Osman Pasha’s sons Mehmet Şamil and Hüseyin Bereket, the group, which included well-known neighborhood boys such as Ahmet Fetgari, Mehmet Ali Fetgeri, Nazımnazif Cemil Feti and Şevket Bey, was also interested in wrestling and weightlifting. But at that time, all public gatherings were strictly banned by the Sultan Abdul Hamid II for political reasons. When the Sultan heard of what was taking place in Serencebey, he ordered his special forces to raid the mansion, and the practicing youngsters were soon taken to the nearest police station. Luckily, since most boys were close to the Palace and did not actually engaged in playing football, a forbidden sport at that time, they were let go without being charged and allowed to carry on.  Furthermore, in the following days, the sultan’s own son Abdülhalim publicly announced his backing of the boys and attended the practice sessions in person frequently. The famous Turkish boxer and wrestler Kenan Bey also started training the boys on a regular basis.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Bereket Gymnastics Club was founded in March 1903 under a special permission from the authorities. After the declaration of constitutional monarchy in 1908, the restrictions on sports were eased considerably.  Following the political events of April 13, 1909, Fuat Balkan and Mazhar Kazancı came to Istanbul from Edirne City with the Ottoman Movement Army. After the restoration of political order, Fuat Balkan, a proven fencing coach, and Mazhar Kazancı, a good wrestler and weightlifter, found the boys in Serencebey and succeeded in persuading them to train together.  Fuat Balkan allowed the first floor of his house in Ihlamur, Beşiktaş to be used as club headquarters, and the title of Bereket Gymnastics Club was changed to Beşiktaş Ottoman Gymnastics Club.  Thus, a sports club with gymnastics, track & field, wrestling, boxing, and fencing sections was founded. Refik and Şerafettin Begs, friends of Fuat Bey, were prominent fencers.

                        <br>
                        With the support of Beyoğlu Governor Muhittin Bey, Beşiktaş Ottoman Gymnastics Club became the first registered Turkish sports club on January 26, 1911.  The interest among local youths in the club grew rapidly, and the number of members actively engaged in club activities went up to 150. The club headquarters eventually was moved from Ihlamur to the larger building, no. 49, in Akaretler. When this building was too small to serve the needs of the club after a while; the building, no. 84, again in Akaretler, became new headquarters. The yard behind this building was turned into a sports pitch.

                    <h3>BEŞİKTAŞ JK'S FIRST CREST AND COLOURS</h3>
                    <p>
                        For years, the original colours of the Beşiktaş were believed to be Red and White; and then temporarily changed into Black and White as a sign of mourning for the dead in Balkan Wars, which included some players of the club. Although most written sources endorse this claim, a detailed study carried out for Beşiktaş’s 100th anniversary documentary had shown that red was never used in club’s first colors; and Beşiktaş’s colours were always Black and White. The 100th Anniversary documentary produced by Mr. Tuğrul Yenidoğan, has put an end to further arguments on the subject once and for all.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since, at the beginning, only individual sports were being practiced in the Osman Pasha Mansion, there was no need for team colours or uniform. However, as the number of active sportsmen increased each passing day; Mehmet Şamil Bey, who had graduated from a well-known French school, asked the Founders Committee to hold a meeting on finding a badge for the club. He removed the pin badge he used in his school days bearing the colours of his school from his lapel and showed it around. He said, “We must have a crest just like this one, and all club members must wear it.” Those attending the meeting eagerly agreed to Mehmet Şamil Bey’s proposal. At the end of the meeting, the colours of the Club to be shown on the crest were decided. The two principal colors of nature in full contrast to each other were chosen as the Club colours: Black and White…

                        The date Beşiktaş’s crest inspired by the pins of a French school has carried the date of “1906,” the year of its first issue, in Latin. At the top, the word “Beşiktaş” was written in Arabic, with the letter “J” on the right and the letter “K” on the left. The inscription at the back of the shows that it was made in “Konstantinopolis,” and the seal of the craftsman who made the crest is placed in the middle. It is interesting that the star on the crest on the pin has six points. This six-pointed star had been used until the Second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908. The original crest was presented to our Honorary Chairman Süleyman Seba by Iskender Yakak
